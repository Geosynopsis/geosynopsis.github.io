Hi, I am Abhishek Manandhar. Call me Abhi! I find it better, and it's a little effort to your tongue. Geosynopsis is the platform I use for sharing the interesting things I stumble upon and some of my works.

Squeezing the satellite/aerial images with algorithms to draw information out of them is my profession. I make machines learn the patterns in those pictures and the information squeezed out of them. Analyzing data to find out the answer to WHERE and all other questions associated with it is something I love to do.

I like how awesomely tech is developing in Geo/Space. It's interesting to see Space X, Blue Origin fighting in the space race. It's quite a pleasure to witness hundreds of tiny minions (Doves) of Planet going around the earth making pictures from every angle. It's awesome to see Mapbox and Carto changing geospatial sector. And I can't wait to see how it's going to develop in few decades.
